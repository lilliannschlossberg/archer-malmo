		<h3> 
			On Thursday December 6th we drove a big yellow schoolbus downtown to Archer>Malmo design firm. We arrived and were shipped upstairs in bunches or 6 to the design floor of Archer Malmo. We were greated by a middle-aged man named Gabe. Gabe was a somber fellow and did not seem very excited about it being direct deposit eve. One of Gabe's coworkers came in and told us to shut up because there was a two person meeting going on in a near room. We were then given a lesson on basic web design process by our somber, sad, lonely friend Gabe. Next Gabe took us up the main floor area of the Archer>Malmo. They had large clear glasses filled to the very, tippest, toppiest, with a plethora of various Web and workplace awards. From there we loaded back onto the elevator and went down to the very lowest area of the large building that houses archer malmo, the basement. From the elevators we dismonted onto the basement room of the Archer Malmo Building. Within the basement was a former storge closet, now turned into a video and brodcasting room. The room has tall cellings with one wall white, one a bright and neon green and one half white and half dark baby blue. Against one wall are shelves filled with filming equipment as well as props for different commercials filmed there. When we were finally finished with our lonely somber and sad friend gabe we went back up to the lobby and left the large building that house archer malmo as well as a few other various memphis businesses. After we walked down the street a whole entire city block in memphis to walk down back to wait for the bus. The bus driver lady said that the bus was here and waiting, but alas it was not there on the street corner waiting for its group of highschool web design students. While we waited forever noah tried to ride a bird scooter but failed. We contined to wait for severl minuites in the freezing cold memphis weather. Finally when the large violent yellow dumb durham school bus arrived we got on one at a time while coah katie sinclair took roll one at a time while we got onto the bus and waited for our individual special self selected buddies. once on the bus we drove towards the fast food establishment or cookout. we waited for the bus to park and the huredly rushed to the front of the bus so we could get in line at our favorite place, cook out. We got in line and i ordered a chicken tortilla tray with two sides of chicken tortillias. so i had four delicous cheesy chickeny tortillia special saucy chicken quesodillas with a huge sweet southern style tea. Then we went home. the end.
